                <p>Hey! I am Aquila. I love laughing. I also love to create. I have been creating things since I was about 8, from baking, to arts and crafts, to poetry. Although I am a newcomer to the field, I am truly excited for what’s to come. The ability to take your idea, or even someone else’s, and turn it into something concrete is an art that I am psyched to take part in.</p>
                <p>I am interested in becoming efficient in both front-end and back-end developing. I play the acoustic guitar (although at a beginner’s level for now), I love to read (but NO fiction), and I am also bi-lingual (Spanish being my second language). My goal is to help others bring life to their businesses and brands and while traveling the world. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
